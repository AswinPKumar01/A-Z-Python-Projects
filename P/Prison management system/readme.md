# Prison Management System

This is a basic Prison Management System implemented in Python. The program allows you to manage prisoners' information, including their personal details, cell allocation, and more. It also provides options for viewing the list of prisoners, searching for a specific prisoner, and saving prisoner data to different file formats.

## Features

- User authentication: Users need to log in with a username and password.
- Add new prisoners: Enter the basic details of a new prisoner, and the system automatically allocates a cell number.
- View prisoner list: Display a list of all prisoners in the system.
- Search for a prisoner: Search for a specific prisoner using their allocated cell number.
- Export prisoner data: Save the prisoner list to a text file, HTML file, or Word document.
- Logout and Exit: Log out of the system or exit the program.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A terminal or command prompt to run the Python script.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you've stored the code.
4. Run the program using the following command:

```python prison_management_system.py```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.

## User Authentication

- The system has predefined user credentials for authentication:
  - Username: maheen, Password: hehehe
  - Username: ayesha, Password: ayeshahere

- The list includes prisoner names, cell block numbers, ages, genders, heights, eye colors, and details of their crimes.

## Searching for a Prisoner

- Choose the "Search prisoner" option.
- Enter the cell number of the prisoner you want to search for.
- The system will display the details of the prisoner if found, or inform you if the cell is empty or the cell number is invalid.

## Exporting Prisoner Data

- Choose the "Prison File" option.
- Select the format in which you want to save the prisoner data (text file, HTML, or Word document).
- The data will be saved to a file in the chosen format.
