# Document Similarity Checker

Document Similarity Checker is a Python script that allows you to measure the similarity between two text documents using natural language processing techniques. The script uses the `nltk` library for text preprocessing and the `scikit-learn` library for vectorization and similarity calculation.

## Usage

1. **Installation**:

   Before using the script, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install nltk scikit-learn
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
